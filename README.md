# Running the app

To start the app, you'll want to run `npm install`, followed by `npm run dev`.

To run tests, use the command `npm test`. The test framework being used is Jest. 

# Notes

There are two tests in the `Transactions` component suite that currently do not pass.

The test suite is rather sparse. If I had more time, I'd add more testing around the content and number of table rows. I'd also add testing around the refresh and pagination functionality. The functions in the utility folder could also use some tests.
